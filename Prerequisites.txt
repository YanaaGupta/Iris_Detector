* NOTE :
Ensure you are using the correct Python interpreter in VSCode that has the required packages installed.

* EXPLANATION OF STEPS :

1. Loading and Exploring the Dataset:
The dataset is loaded from the UCI repository and displayed.

2. Preprocessing:
The species column is converted to numeric values.

3. Feature and Target Separation:
Features (X) and the target variable (y) are separated.

4. Standardizing Features:
Features are standardized using StandardScaler.

5. Data Splitting:
Data is split into training and testing sets.

6. Model Training:
A Logistic Regression model is trained on the training data.

7. Model Evaluation:
The model is evaluated on the test set, and accuracy and classification report are printed.

8. Making Predictions:
A new sample is used to make predictions with the trained model.

9. Saving the Model:
The trained model and scaler are saved using joblib.

10. Loading and Using the Model:
The saved model and scaler are loaded, and a prediction is made with the loaded model to ensure it works.
